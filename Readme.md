Ludum Dare 36: Pyramid Heist
============================

A 2D skill-based platformer where you play as a chicken that must steal ancient artifacts from an egyptian crypt. Mastering the movement mechanic and dodging projectiles is the core focus, but there's also a boss fight and a special ability for those that make it to the end. 


Controller is absolutely recommended.

Left-Stick: Move 

Button 1: Jump and hold to sustain flight 

Button 2: Secret Action (You'll know when to press it!) 

Controls (Keyboard):

WASD: Move 

Left-Click: Jump and hold to sustain flight 

Right-Click: Secret Action (You'll know when to press it!)
