Ludum Dare 36: Pyramid Heist
============================

A 2D skill-based platformer where you play as a chicken that must steal ancient artifacts from an egyptian crypt. Mastering the movement mechanic and dodging projectiles is the core focus, but there's also a boss fight and a special ability for those that make it to the end. 


Controller is absolutely recommended. 

Controls (Controller): 
Left-Stick: Move 
Button 1: Jump and hold to sustain flight 
Button 2: Secret Action (You'll know when to press it!) 

Controls (Keyboard): 
WASD: Move 
Left-Click: Jump and hold to sustain flight 
Right-Click: Secret Action (You'll know when to press it!) 

Tip: Try tapping Jump + a direction to move. You can hold Jump down to perform maneuvers. Have fun!
